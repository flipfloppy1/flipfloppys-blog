The number of blogging frameworks this site has used remains equal to the number of posts it has.

This is because I've moved the blog site from [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) to [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo). Yay!

## The Reasoning

Package management is annoying in ruby and things broke when I came back to it.
It's not the worst as far as programming languages go, but things became incompatible in weird ways rather quickly.
For somebody that gets the burning urge to write a blog post about once every year, it doesn't really work.

Hugo is written in Go, and a lot simpler if you only tend to use the simple features. It also includes some neat features out of the box.
Importantly for me, Go has a reputation of excellent backwards compatibility. 

You'll know whether that reputation extends to Hugo and its templating engine if the site looks a little different the next time I post...
